# 🧠 Simon Game - Test Your Memory!

Welcome to **Simon Game**, the ultimate test of your memory and reflexes! Can you keep up with the ever-growing sequence of lights and sounds? Challenge yourself or your friends to see who can get the highest score in this nostalgic, brain-teasing game!

## 🚀 About the Project
Inspired by the classic **Simon Says** game, this project is a fun and interactive web-based version of the iconic memory game. The rules are simple: watch the pattern of lights and repeat the sequence. But don’t get too comfortable—things will get tricky as the levels progress!

Every round, a new color is added to the pattern, pushing your memory to the limits. Miss a step? Game over! But don’t worry—you can start again at any time and go for an even higher score.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Start the game**: Press any key to kick off the game.
2. **Watch the pattern**: The game will flash a sequence of colors. Pay close attention!
3. **Repeat the pattern**: Click the buttons in the correct order. The sequence gets longer each round.
4. **Keep going**: As long as you follow the pattern correctly, you'll advance to the next level.
5. **Oops!**: If you make a mistake, the game is over! You can restart by pressing any key.

Can you keep up with Simon's increasingly tricky challenges? The real question is: how far can your brain take you?

## ✨ Features

## 🎶 Sounds
Each button has its own unique sound:
- Red = *"beep"*
- Blue = *"boop"*
- Green = *"bop"*
- Yellow = *"buzz"*

And if you make a mistake, you'll hear a **"wrong"** sound to let you know it's game over!
